given steps in README file will not build the tools successfully

tessbaseapi.ccp gives errors saying that there is no glob.h/glob.c. 

to resolve this issue download and add glob.c and glob.h to 
/jni/com_googlecode_tesseract_android/ directory and then 

modify the part of LOCAL_SRC_FILES in android.mk 
in /jni/com_googlecode_tesseract_android/ to look like this

LOCAL_SRC_FILES += \
  pageiterator.cpp \
  glob.c \
  resultiterator.cpp \
  tessbaseapi.cpp
